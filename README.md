# Duck - The Language for Hyperscalers

## ðŸš§ Under Construction
At the current state of the compiler we don't allow any pull requests apart from out core team.
Development is actively running (probably on another branch) and we're also not open for issues yet. But we're open to discuss topics on our discord

Have fun!

Welcome to the official repository of the Duck programming language!

Duck is a modern, compiled programming language designed for the next generation of cloud software. It is built to empower developers creating highly scalable and resilient microservices. At its core, Duck champions **duck typing**, providing flexibility while leveraging the robust, high-performance Go ecosystem. Duck code compiles directly to Go, allowing you to tap into Go's concurrency features, tooling, and extensive libraries seamlessly.

We're working on a book, which will explore the core principles of the language.
For now you can clone the source code and build your own version of the compiler.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:duck-compiler/duckc.git
cd duckc
cargo install --path .
```

This will install dargo onto your system.
