# Duck - The Language for Hyperscalers
Welcome to the official repository of the Duck programming language!

Duck is a modern, compiled programming language designed for the next generation of cloud software. It is built to empower developers creating highly scalable and resilient microservices. At its core, Duck champions **duck typing**, providing flexibility while leveraging the robust, high-performance Go ecosystem. Duck code compiles directly to Go, allowing you to tap into Go's concurrency features, tooling, and extensive libraries seamlessly.

We're working on a book, which will explore the core principles of the language.
For now you can clone the source code and build your own version of the compiler.

> $ git clone git@github.com:duck-compiler/duckc.git
> $ cd duckc
> $ cargo install --path .

This will install dargo onto your system.

Continue with:

> $ dargo --help
