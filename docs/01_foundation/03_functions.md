# Functions
Functions in duck are declared using the `fn` keyword. Functions are essential to every duck program, as every program requires to have a main function, which looks somewhat like
```duck
fn main() {
}
```
It's the main entrypoint for a program, as the name suggests.

Functions in duck can't be nested, so there are only top-level functions. If you need to capsulate the logic inside a lambda expression, which we'll be explained in a later chapter
