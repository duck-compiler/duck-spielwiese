$title = "Variables"

Now that you know how to initialize values, you can make use of that and store them in variables.
To declare a variable you can use the `let` keyword. Which will bind a value to a identifier. At the moment you have to explictly notate the type of a variable, but we're working on a type inference system, which will make life easier here.

```duck
let my_variable: String = "Hallo, Welt";
```
